# Evacuation Route Intelligence System (ERIS)

A dynamic, risk-aware evacuation optimization system that computes time-sensitive escape routes under evolving hazard conditions and traffic congestion.

## 🚀 Overview

This project simulates:

- Hazard spread modeling (fire/flood)
- Traffic congestion dynamics
- Risk-weighted graph optimization
- Time-aware evacuation routing

Unlike traditional navigation systems, ERIS optimizes for **minimum risk exposure**, not just shortest distance.
